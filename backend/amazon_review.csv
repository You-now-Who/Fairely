0,Amarendra Basak,ProsAwesome build. Velocity sensitive keys. Built in arpeggiator and chord mode are very handy. Useful free software packages available. Light and travel friendly. Reasonable price.ConsTouchPads are a little hardOverall worth buying!
1,MC,"In compare to Akai Mpk Mini:Pros:1. Better piano keys size.2. Better software bundle which includes (but not limited to) Ableton Live Lite and Analog Lab.3. Cheaper.4. Build is sturdy and trustworthy. You will frel confident using it.Cons:1. The drum pads are little stiff. Need to press real hard to get any sound out of it. Not a deal breaker though, as you can set the velocity to full from the provided software called Midi Control Center.2. Size is bigger.3. Less popular comparatively, but no issues in finding guides or tutorials online.4. Little heavier.Who should buy Arturia Minilab Mk2?- The one who who is ok with the drum pad, size and weight thing. All the other things are way superior than the Akai mpk mini.I have attached the photo of the product along with the 13inch MacBook M1 and 27inch Display Monitor."
2,Sagar Kaushik,Very good
3,Bikram chandra bhowmik,This is both functionally and aesthetically the best mini MIDI keyboard to me. And it comes with a 5 year warranty (not sure if it's available in India).I can recommend it with full conviction.
4,Nikhil Tamhankar,"A very very nice keyboard with quality keys, pass and knobs with excellent softwares like Ableton Live lite, arturia softwares"
5,Dhruv,Few features not working on fl studio...and in ableton it's completely not working downloaded all the software and all but not working... But maybe it's not hardware problem but for sure it's not working
6,UK Customer,"It’s a great product. It’s slightly heavier than other midi keyboard in range. If you are into midi keyboards, this is possibly one of the best keyboards in terms of quality and sensitivity."
7,Ongey,"Just had to return this. In theory was exactly what I wanted. Taking it out of the box the unit as a whole is awesome, feels well built etc but then I started using it....and those rotary encoders (the knobs). Any rotation medium to slow and the values start jumping arround, sometimes as much as 10%. So bad it is unuseable. You can completely forget about doing a slow filter sweep. Quick search on the internet (and indeed in some of the negative comments here on Amazon) and I am clearly not the only one. The terrible thing about this is apparently Arturia have known about this for at least the last two years, and not just in this device. Needless to say I wont be touching any of their hardware again. Aside from the knobs, I also foud the pads to require too firm a hit to register anything, and sometimes they even played a sound twice from a single hit so beware. Its really wierd, as the unit as a whole feels like they really tried hard to deisgn it well and really put effort into building a good quality product but then put some of the cheapest comeonets in it they could find. What a shameUPDATE 26/07/2020Arturia have just released Firmware update 1.1 ""We’ve adjusted MiniLab MkII’s knobs to be more accurate and sensitive to subtle tweaks "". This may have resolved the knobs issue."
8,80snostalgiafan,"This is a mostly decent second keyboard for a laptop-based musician because it's portable, and it also doesn't take up too much room on a desk. It does have one annoying flaw (see later).The unit comes with configuration files for Analog Lab and Ableton. This make it instantly useful with those two pieces of (supplied) software. People have made helpful midi maps for it for Reaper, check out the Reaper forum in the MIDI section. If you use a different DAW you may need to configure it yourself, as it does not have any other configuration files, nor does it support the standard MCU DAW control protocol. (Of course the keys work for playing notes without requiring any configuration).Physical AppearanceThis unit is beautifully finished, and looks very good on a desktop with its illuminated pads. It has a metal base, which does make it heavier than you would expect. It's slightly wider than a 14 inch laptop, and it fits in my (large) laptop bag on top of the laptop. It would fit in a standard laptop bag by itself.The KeysThe keys are spaced at a pitch of 2.0cm, as opposed to the 2.4cm of a full sized keyboard. They are only 9 cm deep. There are only 25 of them. If you accept these limitations, they are nice keys with a good feel. The velocity sensitivity seems about right, and of course there are octave up and down buttons to reach any note. This is a good keyboard for one handed playing of synths and samplers. If you want to play a piano with both hands, you may wish to look for a full sized keyboard with 61 or 88 keys.Sustain PedalThere is a socket for a standard sustain pedal, which is not supplied. This works as expected, and is much better than having a sustain button on the keyboard.The Pitch and Mod Touch StripsThese work very well, and seem just as useful as the wheels that are found on larger keyboards.The PadsThe pads are easily configurable, and work well as controls for the software. For playing drums, they require a firm hit, and I found it easier to use the keys.Rotary Encoders.I discovered that there has been a problem with the encoders on this unit for a few years. There are complaints all over the internet. The company has recently released a new version of firmware (1.1.2) that is said to address the problems.Most of the time, the encoders now work well. However, there are circumstances where they are so sensitive that it is impossible to accurately select a value. Surprisingly, this applies to both Analog Lab, where it is hard to select a preset, and Ableton, where it is hard to select a row. I suspect that the controller scripts in these applications require further work.I would not choose this controller if my main purpose was to perform live with it using Ableton, due to the difficulty in selecting the required row, and consequent risk of playing the wrong loop.Analog Lab 4 LiteAnalog Lab Lite feels almost like a demo version of Analog Lab. It costs another $69 plus VAT (so about £65) to upgrade to the full version.Ableton Live LiteAbleton Live is excellent for live performance of loop-based music. The limitations of this lite version are not too severe. If you only want to create non-loop-based music, there are better alternatives. If you don't already have a license, this is one way to obtain one.UVI Grand Piano Model DI'm not sure why this full Steinway grand piano application is included with this keyboard. It is not possible to play a piano properly with only 25 keys. I didn't bother to load it as I don't need it.AlternativesMost small keyboards do not have endless encoders. The few that do include the Worlde Tuna Mini and the Subzero Commandkey 25. I chose the Arturia Minilab because it comes from a well known supplier, and because it includes Analog Lab Lite software.The Arturia Keylab 49 comes with the full Analog Lab collection for not much more money than the Minilab plus the upgrade price, if you have room for it.Some M Audio keyboards come with support for multiple DAWs built in.The Behringer X Touch Mini is not a keyboard but it includes a set of endless rotary encoders that ""may"" work better than the Arturia ones, and it could be combined with any other keyboard, including a full sized one. It does support the MCU protocol for various DAWs.There are many inexpensive Ableton controllers, if that is what you need.ConclusionsIf you can live with the occasionally dodgy control knobs, this is in other respects a nice small form-factor keyboard. If it supports the software that you want to use, it could be a decent buy."
9,Amazon Customer,"Ok I bought this keyboard a few weeks ago, but I should have researched it more. It looks great, it feels great...but I reckon it ends all there. IF you are using Ableton than maybe this is a piece of kit you would be interested in but honestly if you are using Logic Pro X then I would say, give it a miss.The keys feel quite good and the size of the keys even though it's a MINI keyboard are very good, the potentiometers (knobs) feel quite good, but they could be better...the pads are too small and often not as responsive especially when play drum fills or similar things.Now let's go to the salient part...the software that comes with it to configure it and to do MIDI changes...MCC or Midi Control Centre...it is not as obvious as you might think to adjust and configure the knobs and pads to work with other VST plug ins...Ableton or Logic or whatever DAW you are planning to use.There is not much info online or for that matters on their website on how to do that...they kind of expect you to be a MIDI guru...it comes with a preset SHIFT+PAD1 that works with their plug in ANALOG LAB and for that plug in it works great (it has been programmed by Arturia and it is a READ ONLY file, you cannot change it) but from that to program the rest of the keyboard it has been headache after headache...I had to watch dozens of unofficial tutorials online to understand how to do that...their customer service keeps replying with custom made emails that say the same thing over and over. Also I thing that I didn't like is that you can program 7 different MIDI Profiles by pressing SHIFT+PAD2, SHIFT+PAD3 and so on....for each one of them you can assign the knobs and pads to a certain midi channel...but the keys stay assigned to Midi channel 1...so while you are expecting the knobs and pads to control one plug in..when you play the keys sends signals to other channels.After 7 days of setting it up and working here and there and then 3 knobs stopped working and after few days and several reset the all keyboard came back to life...I ended up RETURNING it to Amazon.I hope it helps."
10,Asevenc,"Having started on the Korg 25 key and using demo's I felt I was ready to take the next step up. Arturia is popular for vintage Synth enthusiasts. Arturia minilab mk 2 looked good, 25 keys, pads and finger sliders to make reverb etc. I had problems down loading Analog lab lite but customer service helped me by giving me another link. Ive been checking out YouTube seeing how they loop music. I'll get back to you on if I can do it myself.Well I tried Ableton but couldn't get the hang of it I use Magix for my loops and recordings. But don't let that deter you, you might be Ableton work it out! 😂 Bad joke!The touch sensitivity strips were ok, but I felt I couldn't control them as much as the Korg joystick appragator.The keys are a good size but was wary when touching the keys didn't respond as quickly as the Korg, it's with in milliseconds but you can tell.All in all great Software, nice sturdy controller but I'd rather have pitch wheels than strips, I'll be going back to the Korg Microkey 25."
11,Chintan Soni ,"I purchased the Minilab because I wanted a 'sketchpad' for ideas on the go, something with some controllers etc but also a decent keyboard.  Having received the Minilab and had a little play, I decided that it's not what I want, for the following two reasons:- The 25 keys aren't enough - I know it's got to be portable, but I felt I needed more keys- The depth and weight of the device make it less portableHowever, I acknowledge that this is a decent piece of kit - Arturia are well-trusted, and I have their Keylab 61 Essential, which is a great keyboard.  Their synths are also great, and the MiniLab integrates seamlessly.On that note, I find it frustrating that the hardware is often tied-up with the software.  With the MiniLab, you can MIDI configure the knobs etc to a certain extent.  With my current mini-key device, the Komplete Kontrol M32, it's even worse (but it has 32 keys!) - Native Instruments are the Apple of the MIDI world.So, if you want a completely free-of-proprietary device, then maybe you're best off with the equivalent keyboards from Alesis, Nektar, Akai, M-Audio etc (I read reviews of these but rejected either because of keys or portability).  But I can't put down the MiniLab, especially as the keys and build are quality, and it comes with the excellent Analog Lab synth presets.So, make your choice, and I hope that this review is useful!"
